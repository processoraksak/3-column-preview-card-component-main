# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component

This single-component project that I applied responsive web design principles on,
let me improve my confidence in basic CSS, HTML and RWB.

Also, I used media queries for the first time while working on this project.

Thanks, Frontend Mentor to provide me design template of the project.
